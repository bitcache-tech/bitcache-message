Everything rots into incomprehensible complexity over time. One example of this is how pytest
detects the code to be tested.

> pytest will find foo/bar/tests/test_foo.py and realize it is part of a package given that
> thereâ€™s an __init__.py file in the same folder. It will then search upwards until it can find
> the last folder which still contains an __init__.py file in order to find the package root
> (in this case foo/).
